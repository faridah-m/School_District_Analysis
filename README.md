# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the School District has found evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. Maria has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. In so doing, we will be able to compare the analyzed test scores to other schools in the district while avoiding any effects of the tainted data.

## Results
By analyzing the results of the analysis, we will be answering the following questions:

### How is the district summary affected
The district summary was affected as THS 9th grade students averaged higher math reading and overall passing % than the district %. By removing the THS 9th grade results we were able to capture accurate results.
